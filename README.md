# horiseon-seo-refactor

## Description

In this project the code for the Horiseon website was refactored. This means that the previous code has been made more efficient. By doing this the website is now more accessible and also improves search engine optimization without having to change the look of the overall page itself.

## Changes

Some of the changes made include:
* Changing div elements to semantics elements like "header", "section", or "footer" to provide a more logical structure to the source code.

* Alt attributes added to images and icons to provide more accessibility to users

* CSS optimization to reduce the use of repetitive lines of code.

* Consolidation and orginization of CSS selectors to follow HTML's semantic structure
